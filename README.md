I followed this project tutorial by boot.dev 
https://boot.dev/learn/build-local-dev-environment-python

The purpose of this tutorial was to setup the developer environment and get familiar with building projects on our own machine. However, I already know how to do those things. I instead used this as a starting point to familiarize myself with the basic syntax of Go. The tutorial is in python, but the tasks are more general, so it was adequate to learning alongside the Go docs.
